## [Part 0](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part0)
- In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking the course.
- After that, we will have an overview of the basics of web development and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.
  
## [Part 1](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part1)
- In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser.
- We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.
  
## [Part 2](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part2)
- First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen.
- After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms.
- Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server.
- Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
  
## [Part 3](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part3)
- In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack.
- We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database.
- At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

## [Part 4](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part4)
- In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend.
- After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.
  
## [Part 5](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part5)
- In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code.
- We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.
  
## [Part 6](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part6)
- In this part, we will introduce the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.
- We'll learn about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and useRedux hook, as well as the React Query library that simplifies the server state management.
  
## [Part 7](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part7)
- First, we'll get familiar with React router. React router helps us divide the application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser's address bar.
- After this, we'll look at a few more ways to add CSS styles to React applications.
- We shall also have a look at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.

## [Part 8](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part8)
- This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.
  
## [Part 10](https://github.com/JanneJulius/FullStackOPEN/tree/main/Part10)
- In this part, we will learn how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with JavaScript and React using the React Native framework. We will dive into the React Native ecosystem by developing an entire mobile application from scratch.
- Along the way, we will learn concepts such as how to render native user interface components with React Native, how to create beautiful user interfaces, how to communicate with a server, and how to test a React Native application.
